      ABOUT ME Greetings, I am Tung Nguyen, a budding software engineer nestled
      in the vibrant landscapes of California, USA. Having honed my craft
      through a robust educational journey culminating in a Computer Science
      degree from SFSU, I stand on the cusp of translating academic knowledge
      into real-world innovations. Currently engrossed in a self-initiated role
      as a Web Developer, I find myself delving deep into the intricate web of
      backend technologies and cloud platforms, constantly nurturing my passion
      for creating seamless and impactful user experiences. From
      conceptualization to deployment, I have been hands-on, integrating and
      experimenting with cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js, Express, and
      Node. Apart from my educational journey that began at the City College of
      San Francisco, my self-driven projects have been my playing field,
      enabling me to showcase my technical acumen and problem-solving prowess. I
      pride myself on being proficient with a host of programming languages and
      frameworks, all while mastering the art of effective googling, a skill
      that has steered me through many coding challenges. As I venture forth,
      seeking opportunities to intern as a software engineer, I am eager to
      bring my dynamic blend of skills and passion to a forward-thinking team.
      With a knack for both web development and backend technologies, I am
      well-prepared to contribute my bit towards crafting digital solutions that
      resonate with users on a global scale. Feel free to reach out to me at
      tung.nguyen23797@gmail.com, as I keenly look forward to embarking on a
      journey where I can channel my enthusiasm and knowledge towards creating
      products that not only facilitate seamless information transition but also
      possess the potential to transform lives positively.
